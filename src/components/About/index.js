                Memory UP is a card game in which all cards are laid face down
                on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn.
                The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
                However, this is a special version of the game. The difference
                is that each player gets some coins, depending on the difficulty
                he selects. If he doen't find a matching pair, he loses a coin.
                The game finishes as soon as the player has lost all of his
                coins.

                This game was developed from "Theologos Baxevanos" as part of a
                semester exercise for the Fernfachhochschule Schweiz, university
                of applied sciences in Switzerland.
                <br />
                The project could not have been finished without the support of
                the advanced web technologies lecturer "Philipp Lauwiner". A
                huge thank you for making this subject fun and interesting to
                every single one of us.
                <br />
                Have fun playing the game! :)
