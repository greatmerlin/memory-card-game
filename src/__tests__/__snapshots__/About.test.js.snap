            Memory UP is a card game in which all cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. However, this is a special version of the game. The difference is that each player gets some coins, depending on the difficulty he selects. If he doen't find a matching pair, he loses a coin. The game finishes as soon as the player has lost all of his coins.

            This game was developed from "Theologos Baxevanos" as part of a semester exercise for the Fernfachhochschule Schweiz, university of applied sciences in Switzerland.

            The project could not have been finished without the support of the advanced web technologies lecturer "Philipp Lauwiner". A huge thank you for making this subject fun and interesting to every single one of us.

            Have fun playing the game! :)
